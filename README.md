Advance Data Analyst Course - Final Project 

Hi, I'm Roy! I have a technical background and hold an M.B.A degree from IDC, with a major in Business consulting. In the M.B.A, I was in an entrepreneurship program where I revealed the Data world. This led me to transform to Data Analysis role.

I am a data analyst with experience using various tools and technologies to collect, organize, and analyze data to inform business decisions. I've vast experience in SQL, Excel, Power BI, and have a solid understanding of data analytics techniques such as dashboard building, report writing, data mining, data merging & modeling, statistics, and critical thinking. I'm passionate about data, challenge my skills and knowledge and have a high will to solve problems and challenge my skills. I took a year ago an advance data analysis course, and always learning through online platforms such as Udemy, Coursera and more.

In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects at Gstat that showcase my data analytics skills. You will find links of the dashboards and reports I have created using various tools such as Power BI, SQL, and Excel. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for decision makers to understand the insights and take action.
